# DeepLearning
Collection of analytics problems solved using Deep Learning Algorithms

Description about the scripts :-
The code scripts has been written in python using Jupyter Notebook having an extension of ipynb.

Descriptions to run the code scripts :-
The ipynb files can either be run locally or on Google Colab

Pre-requisites for running the code locally :-
The following should be installed on your PC:
1. Python 3
2. Anaconda

Steps to run the ipynb locally :-
1. Go to the folder where the codes have been downloaded (in Windows explorer)
2. Go to the address bar and type 'cmd' (without quotes) and hit enter.
3. When the command prompt window opens type 'jupyter notebook' (without quotes) after the prompt and hit enter.
4. It should automatically open the ipynb file in your default browser e.g. Google Chrome (if there are no errors in set up).
5. If it does not open in your default browser, copy the url from the cmd window and paste it in your browser.
6. If it still does not open, check the errors in the cmd and go through the pre-requisites once.

Steps to run the ipynb file from google colab :-
1. Search 'google colab' (without quotes) in google.
2. Open the link that is listed first in the search results.
3. Click "New Python 3 Notebook".
3. Copy paste all the commands from the ipynb file to the google colab notebook and run them.
4. Make sure that GPU is enabled on Google Colab. (Runtime > Change Runtime type > Hardware Accelerator = GPU)
